#summary SSH usage

= md5merge over SSH =

Merging files over SSH uses the same command as without, only the parameters must be specified correctly:
{{{
     md5merge ssh://user@server1:/media/data/ ssh://root@server2:/media/data/
}}}

This will login user on server1 as well as root on server2, and merge all files in /media/data/ on server2 into /media/data/ on server1. It's as simple as that.
