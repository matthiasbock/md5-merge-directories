#summary SSH usage

= md5merge over SSH =

Merging files over SSH uses the same command as without, only the parameters must be specified correctly:
{{{
     md5merge user@server1:/media/data/ root@server2:/media/data/
}}}

This will login _user_ on _server1_ as well as _root_ on _server2_, and merge all files in _/media/data/_ on _server2_ into _/media/data/_ on _server1_. It's as simple as that. Other than when using ssh from the console, to md5merge you MUST specify a user, else the statement will not be recognized as an SSH location identifier.

Note that : and @ are no special characters, at least not on Linux ext file systems. Whenever an @ is followed by a :/ or :~ in a folder name, md5merge will interpret this as an attempt to use SSH, even if folders actually named like this are present locally!
