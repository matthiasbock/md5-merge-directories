#summary SCP+

= Secure Copy Plus =

SCP+ is a package of extensions for SCP, written in Python.
Additionally provides the following features:

 * *--tbz*: tar and bzip2 files before transfer, unpack on the remote machine after successfull transfer
 * continue interrupted transfers
 * hash to compare source and target file
 * tell hosts to directly transfer to one another (requires source host to have scp+ installed)

== Single file tranfer scenarios ==
 * target file doesn't exist => start transfer
 * target file exists
  * same size
   * equal content => transfer completed
   * different content => ask: overwrite differing file?
  * bigger
   * partial content matches => transfer (is more than) completed
   * different content => ask: overwrite differing file?
  * smaller
   * partial content matches => continue transfer
   * different content => ask: overwrite differing file?

== Continue interrupted transfers ==
 # list local files
 # list remote files
 # list conflicting files
 # if host2 file > host1 file: error
 # elif equal: md5sum & compare
 # elif host2 file < host1 file: dd if=host2 bs=host1 size count=1 | md5sum & compare
 # transfer remaining & concatenate ...
 # transfer unique files
