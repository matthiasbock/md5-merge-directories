SCP+ is a package of extensions for SCP, written in Python.
Additionally provides the following functions:

 * *scp.py --tar.bz*: compress content before transfer, unpack on the remote machine after transfer
 * *scp.py --hash*: compare files after transfer (by MD5 hash)
 * *scp.py --continue* an interrupted transfer
 * *smv.py*: secure move = delete files after secure copying


== --tar.bz ==

 # pack
 # transfer
 # unpack


== --hash ==

 # list all files
 # run host1 md5sum files
 # run host2 md5sum files
 # print list
 # if _--move_ argument is provided to scp.py (as done by smv.py), delete equal files


== --continue ==
 # list local files
 # list remote files
 # list conflicting files
 # if host2 file > host1 file: error
 # elif equal: md5sum & compare
 # elif host2 file < host1 file: dd if=host2 bs=host1 size count=1 | md5sum & compare
 # transfer unique files
