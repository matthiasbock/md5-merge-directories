#summary SCP+

= Secure Copy Plus =

SCP+ is a package of extensions for SCP, written in Python.
Additionally provides the following features:

 * *--tbz*: tar and bzip2 files before transfer, unpack on the remote machine after successfull transfer
 * continue interrupted transfers
 * hash to compare source and target file
 * tell hosts to directly transfer to one another (requires source host to have scp+ installed)

== Single file tranfer scenarios ==
 * target file doesn't exist => start transfer
 * target file exists
  * same size
   * equal content => transfer completed
   * different content => ask: overwrite differing file?
  * bigger
   * partial content matches => transfer (is more than) completed
   * different content => ask: overwrite differing file?
  * smaller
   * partial content matches => continue transfer
   * different content => ask: overwrite differing file?

== Continue transfer ==
 * if source and target local:
  * directly append to target file
 * if one or both remote:
  * check for previously transfered partial content on target machine
   * concatenate
  * extract missing partial content from source file
   * discard already transfered content
  * transfer missing partial content
  * concatenate partial content on target machine

== Partial content files ==

Partial content is filename+'.partial-'+starting byte, where first byte is 0.
