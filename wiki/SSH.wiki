#summary SSH

= SSH =
A Secure Shell is an encrypted remote terminal.

== Introduction ==

Provided that you have a login, you can remotely execute a command on a server, typing the following into your console:
{{{
     ssh user@remote-server.org md5sum /testfile
}}}

== [SSH_Usage smerge over SSH] ==

Using smerge over SSH allows for merging tons of data across a network or the internet without transfering the data. The smerge util instead remotely calls md5sum on the server, thereby requesting the already calculated file hash, rather than requesting the data and calculate it by itself.

== Public Key Authentication ==

Setting up public key authentication is necessary, if you plan to use smerge over SSH. Else many login prompts will show up.
